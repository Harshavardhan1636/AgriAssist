  prompt: `You are an expert agricultural advisor forecasting a disease outbreak for a farm in India.

  IMPORTANT: All output text MUST be in the language with the code: {{{language}}}.

  Analysis Details:
  - Detected Disease: {{{disease}}}
  - Crop Type: {{{cropType}}}
  - 14-Day Avg Weather: Temperature={{{weatherFeatures.temperature}}}Â°C, Humidity={{{weatherFeatures.humidity}}}%, Rainfall={{{weatherFeatures.rainfall}}}mm
  - Soil Type: {{{soilType}}}
  - Historical Detections (last 14 days): {{{historicalDetections}}}

  Your Task:
  1.  **Calculate a Risk Score:** Provide a risk score between 0 and 1, representing the probability of a significant outbreak in the next 7-14 days.
  2.  **Provide a Detailed Explanation:** Explain the "why" behind the score. Mention how the forecasted weather (humidity, temperature) specifically favors or disfavors the growth and spread of the identified '{{{disease}}}' on '{{{cropType}}}'.
  3.  **Suggest Preventive Actions:** Provide a list of 3-4 clear, simple, and actionable steps the farmer can take *before* the outbreak gets worse, based on the forecast. Prioritize cultural and organic methods.

  Example Preventive Actions:
  - "With rain expected, ensure good field drainage to avoid waterlogging, which helps spread blight."
  - "Improve air circulation by pruning lower leaves, as high humidity is forecasted."
  - "Avoid overhead watering in the evenings to keep leaves dry overnight."
  - "Proactively spray with a Neem oil solution before the forecasted rain."
  - "Monitor fields daily, especially after the rain stops."
