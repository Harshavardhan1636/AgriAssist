# AgriAssist 3.0: Technical Documentation

This document provides comprehensive technical documentation for the AgriAssist 3.0 project, including architecture, implementation details, and API specifications.

## Project Overview

AgriAssist is a web application designed to act as a "Digital Health Twin" for a farm. It uses AI to analyze images of crops, diagnose diseases, assess severity, and forecast outbreak risks. This tool is intended to help farmers and agronomists make informed decisions to protect their crops.

## Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built using Next.js 15.3.3 with the App Router, React, and TypeScript. The UI components are based on shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS for styling.

#### Key Components

1. **Dashboard Layout**: Main application layout with sidebar navigation
2. **Analysis Module**: Core functionality for crop disease analysis
3. **AI Conversations**: Persistent chat system for follow-up questions
4. **History & Review**: Analysis history and expert review queue
5. **Store**: Integrated marketplace for agricultural products
6. **Community**: Outbreak alerts and knowledge sharing
7. **Knowledge Sharing**: Farmer-to-farmer platform with problem sharing and solutions
8. **Crop Planning**: Seasonal planting recommendations and crop rotation planning

### Backend Architecture (Prototype)

The current implementation is a frontend prototype with simulated backend services. The actual backend would use Firebase services including Authentication, Firestore, and Cloud Functions.
